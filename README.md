# Assist-Aid

Hey there! üëã This is a web app I built to help people manage their assistance applications. It's designed to be super user-friendly and accessible to everyone, no matter what language they speak or what device they're using.

## What's Inside? üõ†Ô∏è

I've used some pretty cool tech to build this:

### Frontend Stuff

- **React** - Because it's awesome for building UIs
- **TypeScript** - To catch those pesky bugs before they happen
- **Tailwind CSS** - Makes styling a breeze
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible components out of the box
- **React Hook Form** - Handles all the form stuff (and there's a lot of it!)
- **i18next** - Makes the app speak multiple languages
- **React Router** - For smooth navigation between pages

### Backend Integration

- **API Client** - Built this to handle all the API calls with:
  - Smart retries when things go wrong
  - Timeout handling (because waiting forever is no fun)
  - Proper error messages (no more cryptic errors!)
  - Type safety (TypeScript is friend)
- **OpenAI Integration** - Helps users write better applications
- **Email Service** - Keeps users in the loop about their application status
  - Powered by Resend API for reliable email delivery
  - Currently limited to admin emails for demo purposes
  - Can be extended to send emails to any recipient with proper API key configuration

## Why These Tech Choices? ü§î

### React + TypeScript

I chose these because:

- TypeScript catches bugs before they happen
- Better developer experience (less guessing)
- Easier to refactor (we all know code changes)
- Great IDE support
- Code documents itself

### Tailwind CSS

Because:

- Super fast to style things
- Consistent look and feel
- Small file size
- Easy to customize
- Dark mode built-in

### shadcn/ui

It's awesome because:

- Accessible by default
- Easy to customize
- Type-safe
- No extra JavaScript
- Easy to maintain
